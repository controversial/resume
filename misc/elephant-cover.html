        Dear Elephant,
      </p>
      <p class="mt-3 text-m text-gray-700 leading-normal">
        I’m very excited to learn of the opportunity for internship positions at Elephant. I’ve been
        working at a small digital studio in the Hudson Valley for the past two summers helping to
        craft compelling digital experiences for a variety of clients. I find Elephant’s focus on
        the human experience&mdash;combining UX and brand experience with a larger cultural
        experience&mdash;to be fascinating and deeply compelling.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-3 text-m text-gray-700 leading-normal">
        My personal focus has been on the intersection of design and technology, and I engage much
        more readily with creative problems than purely technical ones. I view software as a
        platform for creative expression that combines design, technology, and human experience.
        I’ve been building websites and web apps for five years now, during which time I’ve mastered
        JavaScript, CSS, HTML, React, and Vue. While at first, I started out by building simple
        static sites using prebuilt component libraries, my skillset has followed my passion, and
        I’ve gained expertise in building interactive web experiences from the ground up. Today, my
        favorite projects to work on are those driven by rich animation, thoughtful responsive
        design, and complex functionality. I’ve loved the process of learning along the way more
        than anything else. Expanding my technical knowledge has always felt exciting because it is
        empowering; expanding my toolset enables me to implement ideas that were previously out of
        reach, thereby unlocking entire new sectors of possibility.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-3 text-m text-gray-700 leading-normal">
        One project I’d like to bring to your attention is Sleep Later
        (<a href="https://sleeplater.now.sh">sleeplater.now.sh</a>), an e-commerce web app that I
        designed and developed as a freelance project for a local fashion brand. I started by
        creating a brand identity, and then developed a unified digital experience that reinforces
        that identity consistently as customers move from browsing through products all the way to
        checkout. I designed the entire site in Sketch, and built the whole experience by hand in
        Vue, which I learned as I went. I also developed an Airtable integration that allowed the
        client to track and update inventory and orders.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-3 text-m text-gray-700 leading-normal">
        Working at Elephant would give me an opportunity to build on this experience and create
        similar product experiences for some of the brands I most admire and reach worldwide
        audiences. Given my skills, experience and passions, I’m confident that I could value to the
        Elephant team as either a Creative Technology Intern or an Engineering Intern. I’m excited
        by the work Elephant has done as well as its mission, and I’d love the opportunity to spend
        another summer working to bring engaging and beautiful experiences to life.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-3 text-m text-gray-700 leading-normal">
        Thanks in advance for your consideration.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-6 text-m text-gray-700 leading-normal">
        Regards,
        <br/>
        Luke Deen Taylor
